# AR Pendulum Motion Project

This Unity project is an Augmented Reality (AR) application that uses Vuforia for object tracking. It visualizes the physical forces acting on a ball in pendulum motion.

## Features

- **Object Tracking**: Utilizes Vuforia to track a target object in the real world.
- **Physics Visualization**: Demonstrates the forces acting on a pendulum, including gravity, tension, and inertia.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.3 or later
- Vuforia Engine SDK

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AR-Physics-Experimant-Tool.git
   cd AR-Physics-Experimant-Tool
2. **Install Vuforia**
  - https://developer.vuforia.com/library/getting-started/vuforia-engine-package-unity
3. **Create Model Target**
  - Vuforia model target as a set of files combining all required 3d model features. It represents the model which is supposed to be found and tracked.
  - https://developer.vuforia.com/library/objects/model-target-generator-user-guide
4. **Adjust scene and custom scripts**
  - Unity Version Control tends to mess up a little, so the SampleScene.unity may miss all references in the inspector window.
